						Generating MRI images is not enough â€“<br> 
						the images must be analyzed by experts in order to decipher<br> 
						precise structural details. Some software exist to help but a<br> 
						tremendous amount of expert time is required to verify and fix<br> 
						software mistakes. And every day as more public datasets<br> 
						are generated, the gap between raw image data<br> 
						and annotated datasets widens.

						This is why we are creating the Open Neuroimaging Lab!<br>
						An online platform for collaborative, crowdsourced analysis.<br> 
						The Lab will help train scientists and engage the public using<br> 
						game-like apps, and improve transparency, statistical power,<br> 
						and reproducibility of science.

						The Lab will provide Collective analysis tools<br> 
						for researchers. An easy and fast access encourages sharing of data,<br> 
						and the ability to create and curate catalogues of shared data in<br> 
						real-time and social interaction. A first citizen science project<br> 
						within the Lab is the app <b><a target="_blank" href="http://brainbox.pasteur.fr">BrainBox</a></b>.

						The browser-based application allows individuals to work<br>

						clinical populations, and unique individuals, without having to download complete<br> 
						datasets or install software. The app will index available data as they are used,<br> 
						and store annotation and analysis results for reuse.

				BrainBox is a web application by <b><a target="_blank" href="http://neuroanatomy.github.io">NAAT</a></b> to
				visualise and segment collaboratively any brain MRI dataset available online.
				Segmentations are automatically saved and can be downloaded as Nifti 2 files or
				triangular meshes. Point BrainBox to your own Nifti 2 data, or try data catalogues
				created by the community.
